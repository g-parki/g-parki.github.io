                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>I love making sense of data, and I love building software to do so. As a mechanical engineer I quickly grew a reputation as
                    <em>"the database guy"</em> because I wasn't afraid to learn new tools, build reports, and write scripts to automate them.
                    This led me down a path of <b>web development</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, and <b>open source contribution</b>, while learning several languages
                    along the way.

                            This is a complete machine learning project from data collection to production. I first connected to the API for our Google Nest camera
                            and collected thousands of training images. I manually categorizeed the images as "baby in crib" or "baby not in crib".<br>
                            I then constructed a neural network and trained it with this data. This was a long, interative process as
                            I recognized various weaknesses in the neural networks (e.g. shortcuts by recognizing lighting patterns), and would then collect additional data and modify training methods to improve the model.<br><br>
                            The project was then bundled into a web app to provide:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Database for recording baby presence every 10 minutes</li>
                                <li>Aggregation of data into "bedtimes"</li>
                                <li>Live video feed, with live inference from the latest model</li>
                                <li>Visualization of bedtimes for the week</li>
                                <li>Meta-project information
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>UI for saving data from the live feed</li>
                                        <li>A page for each model containing its hyperparameter info and a visualization of its accuracy.</li>
                                        <li>A view of all data with ability to correct its value</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            Since this app was for private consumption (and due to privacy concerns), this is not deployed. Please see additional demos in the repository.

                            Early in the pandemic I grew frustrated with the lack of trended data available for Cowlitz County.
                            So I wrote a script to scrape their website every day,
                            normalize the data to account for reporting gaps, compute 7-day rolling averages,
                            and tweet an updated graph of cases. <br>
                            Official reporting is now improved, so this bot is no longer active.

                            is a single-feature linear regression in the form <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>y = mx + b</code></span> Where <code>m</code> and <code>b</code>

                            R<sup>2</sup> is a statistical measure showing how much the model fits the data. The best case is R<sup>2</sup>=1, where the model perfectly predicts the data.
                            A useless model would score R<sup>2</sup>=0 or worse.<br>
                            In this case, the R<sup>2</sup> score is 0.64.
